#### Quick-start guide

The numerical naming of .R files corresponds approximately to the order in which those files are run: 

* Scripts numbered 0--2 construct the basic functions and parameter inputs required to simulate the model (and are used in all subsequent analyses);
* Scripts numbered 3a, 3b simulate the model with baseline parameter values;
* Scripts numbered 4a--4c simulate the main results with different assumptions about vaccine effects (indirect or not) and parameter sampling distributions (uniform or not);
* Scripts numbered 5a--5d conduct sensitivity analyses (one-way, two-way and multi-way (via partial-rank correlation coefficient analysis));
* Scripts numbered 6a, 6b create the figures.
